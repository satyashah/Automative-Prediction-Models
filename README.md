Various Models (Deep Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, K-nearest Neighbor, Multiple Model Ensemble) built using tensorflow for automotive value prediction

This project represents a focused selection of the extensive machine learning endeavors undertaken during my internship at Raytheon. Under the guidance and leadership of Jarick Cammarato, a distinguished Software Engineering Manager at Raytheon Technologies, I delved into various facets of machine learning to contribute meaningfully to the organization's objectives. Through this endeavor, I aimed to showcase not only my proficiency in machine learning but also the breadth and depth of my contributions within a dynamic and challenging professional environment.
